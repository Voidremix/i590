        This project was conducted on a fake college website in order to evaluate
        accessibility criteria. The analysis was done by myself and checked against
        WCAG 2.0 Guidelines. I thought that this assignment was interesting and it 
        made me realize how much goes into accessible technology creation and the 
        thought behind why certain programs are or are not accessible. There is a
        lot that goes into creating accessible technology, but it is not that much 
        of a hassle to design with accessibility in mind.
