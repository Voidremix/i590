        Project 1: Web Accessibility Evaluation

    <p>
        This project was conducted on a fake college website in order to evaluate
        accessibility criteria. The analysis was done by myself and checked against
        WCAG 2.0 Guidelines. I thought that this assignment was interesting and it 
        made me realize how much goes into accessible technology creation and the 
        thought behind why certain programs are or are not accessible. There is a
        lot that goes into creating accessible technology, but it is not that much 
        of a hassle to design with accessibility in mind.

        Interpretative Summary <br>
This website appears to be close to meeting the WCAG 2.0 Level A 
accessibility requirements. There are some intermediate and 
novice-level accessibility issues that require attention including 
page navigation and closed captions for media content. Accessibility 
features in which this site is strong include readability, minimalism,
and content clarity. The recommended priorities for addressing 
existing usability issues moving forward are that the landing page be 
amended first, followed by other pages in no set order for smaller fixes 
and streamlining. The suggested changes are outlined more clearly below 
as they relate to each web accessibility issue.
    </p>
    <br><br>

    <p>
        Problem #1 – No Landmarks <br><br>
Description: Skip links allow users to instantly navigate to sections of 
content on a page using different links. ARIA landmark roles are given to 
specific page elements that are similar to skip links but instead provide 
a more in-depth structure to a page or website. <br>
Impact: Landmarks help sighted and visually impaired keyboard-only users navigate page sections. Individuals that use screen readers or other assistive devices may have trouble navigating through page content or understanding their location on the website without having more guidance. <br>
Relevant WCAG 2.1 Guidelines: <br>
• Guideline 2.4 Navigable <br>
- 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks – Level A <br>
Recommendations: Code landmarks into the landing page and sub-pages to make content easier to navigate through. Example: "div role="main" aria-labelledby="title1"" - give page elements a role and sub-elements a label for easier navigation with a screen reader or other AT. <br>

    <br><br>
    
    <p>
        Problem #2 – Missing Video Captions <br><br>
Description: On the “about” page, the associated video does not include closed captions or an alternate method to view the spoken content. <br>
Impact: Users who are hearing impaired will miss out on the content of this video since there are no closed captions or a written transcript available. Additionally, an error message stating “Your browser does not support the video tag” is within the code but does not appear to be present on the site, which could make playback confusing for users. <br>
Relevant WCAG 2.1 Guidelines:
• Guideline 1.2 Time-Based Media
- 1.2.2 Captions (Prerecorded) – Level A
Recommendations: Add closed captions to the participation video on the about page. “Hello, my name is Sheila Larson and I’m the primary investigator of a research lab at University of Newbridge State conducting an ethnographic investigation into the practices that people with disabilities engage in when navigating with digital information. As part of this investigation, researchers will be conducting contextual observation of users in-situ web browsing behaviors when mediated by assistive technologies. If you’re interested in participating, please review the eligibility criteria and thank contact us through the “Contact” page. Thank you!”. <br>

    <br><br>
    
    <p>
        Problem #3 – Lack of Scalability <br><br>
Description: There is an overall lack of scaling ability on the website encompassing most page elements. If the page window is re-sized manually, content will remain the same size and may change position on the page. <br>
Impact: For those individuals who are only slightly visually impaired or are more so hearing impaired, the lack of scalability for site elements may cause issues. The current font size is quite small, and there are instances of absolute sizing hardcoded into page elements without adjustable sizing options. Using percentages instead of pixels or points can remedy this issue. <br>
Relevant WCAG 2.1 Guidelines: <br>
• Guideline 1.4 Distinguishable <br>
- 1.4.4 Resize Text – Level AA <br>
Recommendations: Include scalable elements within the page code or set the page to an absolute position within CSS. <br>
        Example: CSS - <br>
#header {width:100%; background:#f00;} <br>
#footer {width:100%; background:#f00;bottom:0;position:absolute;} <br><br>
        
<p>
    Ongoing – <br>
I think that, moving forward, the page should have an analytics software running so that they may track page visits and user navigation. If errors still persist, consider incorporating a short survey upon site entry/exit to find out why users are navigating to this page but not engaging. Continually testing new and legacy content against accessibility standards will help with improving the overall site accessibility and effectiveness. <br>
