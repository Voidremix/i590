# I590 Spring 2021
## Project 1: Web Accessibility Evaluation
#### Chris Jackson clj25@iu.edu
   
#### This project was conducted on a fake college website in order to evaluate accessibility criteria. The analysis was done by myself and checked against WCAG 2.0 Guidelines. I thought that this assignment was interesting and it made me realize how much goes into accessible technology creation and the thought behind why certain programs are or are not accessible. There is a lot that goes into creating accessible technology, but it is not that much of a hassle to design with accessibility in mind.
